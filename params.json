{"name":"Data Analysis on Movie Filming Locations","tagline":"Final Project for CS 109","body":"After we watch a great film, such as Skyfall, Lord of the Rings or the Harry Potter series, the elements of the films that captivate us and linger in our minds are storyline, actors and the locations that these films were set in. The location allows the audience to be fully immersed in the atmosphere of the story and transports them into the cinematic environment of the film. That is why people flock to visit film locations of famous films. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQsGefiZ-0qZLQw6c_rcH92Htq-qrYo8xNQzfXjpekLXl1AmogAIg\" width=300)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we think of Skyfall, we invariably recall the iconic London city skyline and we reminisce the scenic and breathtaking views of New Zealand from Lord of the Rings. These great films make us remember these awesome places in the world, but have you considered that it may be the locations of the film that determine to the success of these films? \r\n\r\n![london skyline](http://cdni.condenast.co.uk/480x320/s_v/view-of-river-thames-big-ben-london-eye-london-conde-nast-traveller-29oct14-alamy_480x320.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 1. Overview\r\nIn this project, we will do an exploratory analysis of the relationship between film locations and the reception of the films. The aim is to find out how much influence film locations have on the the success of films and how to we can use the locations to predict whether a film will be well received. In addition, we will also consider the effect that genres have on films. We will scrape film data from IMDB. \r\n\r\nWe will apply linear regression on the data to study the effects of each location and genre on user ratings. After which, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of our data set. Then, logistic regression and k-Nearest Neighbours(kNN) will be used for classification and the accuracy of both estimators will be compared to a baseline. Visualisation of results will be done via graphical plots and Tableau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Data Acquisition & Management\r\nThe data from IMDB which gives us information about each film title such as country, critic ratings, genre, location, release dates, url, user ratings, user ratings count and year. The code for web scraping can be found in a separate notebook. Though we planned to work with a data set of 12,000 titles initially, a preliminary test run of PCA, particularly with around 18,000 features of locations and genres, indicated that it was infeasible. Instead, we reduce the size of our data to 10,000 titles. To do so, we scraped IMDB for all film titles from 2009 to 2014. Titles without user ratings, film locations and genres are then removed from our data set. Subsequently, we pick 10,000 titles randomly from the remaining pool of titles.\r\nFirst, we convert user ratings to a binary feature where \"1\" indicates that the film was well-received while \"0\" indicates otherwise. Initially, the threshold rating for determining if a film is well-received was not \"5\" nor is it a randomly chosen number. Instead, we looked at the spread of user ratings across our data. Films with ratings in the top 50% were assigned \"1\" while films in the bottom 50% were assigned \"0\". Though such conversion of user ratings might raise problems, the intention here is to have a balanced number for both sides; additionally, this technique can be applied to larger data sets where the threshold is determined by the data in hand. However, after some considerations, it was decided that \"5\" will be taken as the threshold since, intuitively, \"5\" is the boundary most people use when deliberating whether or not they like a film.\r\nFor locations, substantial data cleaning is required. This is largely due to film locations being user-contributed. Hence, we face problems like spelling mistakes, multiple entries of similar details or details with trivial differences that were irrelevant to our study. For example, some locations are specific to the street while others merely state the country. In cleaning up the feature \"locations\", we had considered two approaches which are elaborated below.\r\n\r\n### 2.1. Approach 1\r\n\r\nWe restrict \"locations\" to cities and countries. Using a list of cities, that we acquired online, and countries across the world, we split the entries of \"locations\" for each title by the commas into phrases. This is because most entries take the form - (specific location),(city),(country) - with various titles having anomalous and repeated entries. Phrases that appear in the list of cities and countries are kept while other location details are discarded. While this resulted in some problems, one particularly interesting issue was that many countries had names shared by cities.\r\nFor example, China turned out to be the name of a city in Texas as well. As a result, if a film was filmed in China, Texas, it would be recorded as being filmed in the country China as well. However, given that these cities with similar names to countries are not especially known widely, we assume that such occurrences are rare anomalies. In addition, we chose to include countries so as to mitigate this problem since our hypothetical film will be recorded as being filmed in China and USA. As such, it is true that the film was filmed in USA but merely a rare anomaly that it is erroneously recorded to be filmed in China too.\r\nWhile Approach 2 below was also considered, Approach 1 was taken instead due to the complexity of the latter.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
