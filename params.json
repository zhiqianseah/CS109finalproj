We hypothesize that awesome films are defined by their locations. Remember the deserted island from _Skyfall_? Or even the iconic London skyline that we associate with the _Bond_ films.\r\n\r\n![London Skyline]<img src=\"http://www.startuproar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/london.jpg\">\r\n\r\nHow about the cliffs of Moher from _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_? Epic scenes draw us into the experience of the film, immersing us fully in the stories and atmosphere of the cinematic environment. This is why many fans flock to the film locations of their favourite films.\r\n\r\n![Cliffs of Moher]<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/rezgo/7225/46198/74386.jpg\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1. Overview\r\nIn this project, we will do an exploratory analysis of the relationship between film locations and the reception of the films. The aim is to find out how much influence film locations have on the the success of films and how to we can use the locations to predict whether a film will be well received. In addition, we will also consider the effect that genres have on films. We will scrape film data from IMDB. \r\n\r\nWe will apply linear regression on the data to study the effects of each location and genre on user ratings. After which, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of our data set. Then, logistic regression and k-Nearest Neighbours(kNN) will be used for classification and the accuracy of both estimators will be compared to a baseline. Visualisation of results will be done via graphical plots and Tableau.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://prosimianmedia.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/interstellar-23.jpg\">\r\n\r\n### 2. Data Acquisition & Management\r\nThe data from IMDB which gives us information about each film such as the country, critic ratings, genre, film location, release dates, user ratings and year. The data consists of film titles from 2009 to 2014. Titles without user ratings, film locations and genres are removed from our data set. Subsequently, we pick 10,000 titles randomly from the remaining pool of titles. We classified films with ratings > 5 as '1' and the rest as '0'.\r\n\r\n> ## \"Data, data, data. I can not make bricks without clay.\"\r\n>_Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes (2009)_ \r\n\r\nSubstantial data cleaning was done to eliminate problems like spelling mistakes or multiple entries of similar details. We restrict the locations to cities and countries by comparing the data with a list of cities and countries. While this resulted in some problems that we eventually resolved, one particularly interesting issue was that many countries had names shared by cities. For example, China turned out to be the name of a city in Texas as well.\r\n\r\n![sherlock holmes](https://apercucinephilia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/lr-sherlock2.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 3. Data Analysis\r\n\r\nUsing the cleaned data, we took a preliminary look at the top 15 locations where films were shot at. It can be seen a majority of the films were set in the USA and parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n![bar chart of top 15 locations](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/02%20bar%20chart%20top%2015%20locations.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nBy doing linear regression of the ratings on the locations and genres, we are able find out how much impact the top 15 locations and genres have on the ratings. \r\n\r\n![location coefficient estimates](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/06%20location%20coeff%20estimates.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n![genre coefficient estimates](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/07%20genre%20coeff%20estimates.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n![actual vs predicted ratings](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/08%20histogram%20predicted%20vs%20actual%20ratings.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n![star wars tatooine](https://www.komar.de/fileadmin/media/Fototapeten_Bilder/8-484_Star_Wars_Lost_Droids_ma.jpg)\r\n\r\n> ## \"Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\"\r\n>_Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_\r\n\r\n### 4. Classification\r\n\r\nWe reduced the dimension of the data using PCA and obtained 1500 components that account for 95% variability in the features. Logistic regression and kNN classifiers were trained and our results show that the accuracy of these classfiers outperform the baseline slightly.\r\n\r\n![godzilla](https://jaredandkyal.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/godzilla-2014-movie-screenshot-old-monster.jpg)\r\n\r\n>## \"I need to establish baseline data..\"\r\n>_Godzilla (2014)_\r\n\r\n![classifier accuracy](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/09%20classifier%20accuracy.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n>## \"This data makes no sense.\"\r\n>_Interstellar (2014)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> ## \"And Edmund's data is better\"\r\n>_Interstellar (2014)_\r\n\r\n> ## \"The data just doesn't justify this test.\"\r\n>_Spider-Man (2002)_\r\n\r\n\r\n> ## \"OKAY, WHAT IS REGRESSION ANALYSIS?\"\r\n>_The Double (2014)_\r\n\r\n> ## \"...it makes me sad, this regression.\"\r\n>_The Departed (2006)_","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
