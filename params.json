{"name":"Data Analysis on Movie Filming Locations","tagline":"Final Project for CS 109","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\n_The Lord of the Rings_, _Harry Potter_ and _Star Wars_. What do these films have in common?\r\n\r\n![Three Old Men](http://img03.deviantart.net/4431/i/2012/044/f/6/three_wise_men_color_by_csoro-d4pmlv2.jpg)\r\n\r\nWell, besides having a powerful old man mentoring a young boy.\r\n\r\n![minas tirith](http://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/the-return-of-the-king.jpg)\r\n\r\nThat's right, spectacular film locations!\r\n\r\nThis project stemmed from the belief that great film locations make great films...GREAT! We hypothesize that awesome films are defined by their locations. Remember the deserted island from _Skyfall_? Or the iconic London skyline that we associate with the _Bond_ films?\r\n\r\n![London Skyline](http://www.startuproar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/london.jpg)\r\n\r\nHow about the cliffs of Moher from _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_? Epic scenes draw us into the experience of the film, immersing us fully in the stories and atmosphere of the cinematic environment. This is why many fans flock to the film locations of their favourite films.\r\n\r\n![Cliffs of Moher](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rezgo/7225/46198/74386.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn this project, we explore the relationship between film locations and the reception of the films. The objective is to find out how much influence film locations have on user ratings of films and attempt to predict if a film will be well received. In our analysis, we also account for the effect of genres on film reception.\r\n\r\n![Interstellar](https://prosimianmedia.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/interstellar-23.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Data\r\n\r\n> # \"Data, data, data. I can not make bricks without clay.\"\r\n> Sherlock, _Sherlock Holmes_ (2009) \r\n\r\nWe obtain our data by scraping films between 2009 and 2014 from IMDB. Out of the 18,000 films that we obtained, those without locations, genres or user ratings were dropped. Then, 10,000 films were randomly sampled to form our data set.\r\n\r\n![sherlock holmes](https://apercucinephilia.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/lr-sherlock2.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe filming locations of each film are user-contributed, resulting in many spelling mistakes and repeated entries. In order to obtain clean filming locations information, we extracted locations that corresponded to a list of cities and countries. In the process, we also discovered many interesting places. For example, there is a city in Texas called China and a county in Pennsylvania called King of Prussia. Eventually, we are left with a data set containing 4802 locations (of cities and countries) and 24 genres.\r\n\r\n![histogram of user ratings](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/01%20histogram%20of%20user%20rating.png)\r\n\r\nThe distribution of user ratings look normal with mean around 5.7. It appears that none of the films have a user rating of 10. \r\n\r\n![bar chart of top 15 locations](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/02%20bar%20chart%20top%2015%20locations.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nLooking at the top 15 film locations, it is no surprised that majority of the films are filmed in USA and western Europe.\r\n\r\n![bar chart of top 15 genres](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/04%20bar%20chart%20top%2015%20genre.png)\r\n\r\nAs for genres, drama and comedy are the most common.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will apply linear regression on the data to study the effects of each location and genre on user ratings. After which, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of our data set. Then, logistic regression and k-Nearest Neighbours(kNN) will be used for classification and the accuracy of both estimators will be compared to a baseline. Visualisation of results will be done via graphical plots and Tableau.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Data Acquisition & Management\r\nThe data from IMDB which gives us information about each film such as the country, critic ratings, genre, film location, release dates, user ratings and year. The data consists of film titles from 2009 to 2014. Titles without user ratings, film locations and genres are removed from our data set. Subsequently, we pick 10,000 titles randomly from the remaining pool of titles. We classified films with ratings > 5 as '1' and the rest as '0'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubstantial data cleaning was done to eliminate problems like spelling mistakes or multiple entries of similar details. We restrict the locations to cities and countries by comparing the data with a list of cities and countries. While this resulted in some problems that we eventually resolved, one particularly interesting issue was that many countries had names shared by cities. For example, China turned out to be the name of a city in Texas as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 3. Data Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy doing linear regression of the ratings on the locations and genres, we are able find out how much impact the top 15 locations and genres have on the ratings. \r\n\r\n![location coefficient estimates](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/06%20location%20coeff%20estimates.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n![genre coefficient estimates](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/07%20genre%20coeff%20estimates.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n![actual vs predicted ratings](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/08%20histogram%20predicted%20vs%20actual%20ratings.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n![star wars tatooine](https://www.komar.de/fileadmin/media/Fototapeten_Bilder/8-484_Star_Wars_Lost_Droids_ma.jpg)\r\n\r\n> ## \"Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\"\r\n>_Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)_\r\n\r\n### 4. Classification\r\n\r\nWe reduced the dimension of the data using PCA and obtained 1500 components that account for 95% variability in the features. Logistic regression and kNN classifiers were trained and our results show that the accuracy of these classfiers outperform the baseline slightly.\r\n\r\n![godzilla](https://jaredandkyal.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/godzilla-2014-movie-screenshot-old-monster.jpg)\r\n\r\n>## \"I need to establish baseline data..\"\r\n>_Godzilla (2014)_\r\n\r\n![classifier accuracy](https://github.com/zhiqianseah/CS109finalproj/blob/master/cs109%20project%20images/09%20classifier%20accuracy.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n>## \"This data makes no sense.\"\r\n>_Interstellar (2014)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> ## \"And Edmund's data is better\"\r\n>_Interstellar (2014)_\r\n\r\n> ## \"The data just doesn't justify this test.\"\r\n>_Spider-Man (2002)_\r\n\r\n\r\n> ## \"OKAY, WHAT IS REGRESSION ANALYSIS?\"\r\n>_The Double (2014)_\r\n\r\n> ## \"...it makes me sad, this regression.\"\r\n>_The Departed (2006)_","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
