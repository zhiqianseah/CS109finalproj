{"name":"Data Analysis on Movie Filming Locations","tagline":"Final Project for CS 109","body":"After we watch a great film, such as Skyfall, Lord of the Rings or the Harry Potter series, the elements of the films that captivate us and linger in our minds are storyline, actors and the locations that these films were set in. The location allows the audience to be fully immersed in the atmosphere of the story and transports them into the cinematic environment of the film. That is why people flock to visit film locations of famous films. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/the-return-of-the-king.jpg\">\r\n\r\nWhen we think of Skyfall, we invariably recall the iconic London city skyline and we reminisce the scenic and breathtaking views of New Zealand from Lord of the Rings. These great films make us remember these awesome places in the world, but have you considered that it may be the locations of the film that determine to the success of these films? \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.startuproar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/london.jpg\">\r\n\r\n### 1. Overview\r\nIn this project, we will do an exploratory analysis of the relationship between film locations and the reception of the films. The aim is to find out how much influence film locations have on the the success of films and how to we can use the locations to predict whether a film will be well received. In addition, we will also consider the effect that genres have on films. We will scrape film data from IMDB. \r\n\r\nWe will apply linear regression on the data to study the effects of each location and genre on user ratings. After which, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of our data set. Then, logistic regression and k-Nearest Neighbours(kNN) will be used for classification and the accuracy of both estimators will be compared to a baseline. Visualisation of results will be done via graphical plots and Tableau.\r\n\r\n### 2. Data Acquisition & Management\r\nThe data from IMDB which gives us information about each film such as the country, critic ratings, genre, film location, release dates, user ratings and year. The data consists of film titles from 2009 to 2014. Titles without user ratings, film locations and genres are removed from our data set. Subsequently, we pick 10,000 titles randomly from the remaining pool of titles. We classified films with ratings > 5 as '1' and the rest as '0'.\r\n\r\nSubstantial data cleaning was done to eliminate problems like spelling mistakes or multiple entries of similar details. We restrict the locations to cities and countries by comparing the data with a list of cities and countries. While this resulted in some problems, one particularly interesting issue was that many countries had names shared by cities. For example, China turned out to be the name of a city in Texas as well.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://prosimianmedia.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/interstellar-23.jpg\">","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
